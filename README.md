# The-BeeImage-Dataset-Annotated-Honey-Bee-Images
Every third bite of food relies on pollination by bees. At the same time, this past winter honeybee hive losses have exceeded 60% in some states. How can we address this issue? How can we better understand our bees? And most importantly, how can we save them before it's too late?</br>
While many indications of hive strength and health are visible on the inside of the hive, frequent check-ups on the hive are time-consuming and disruptive to the bees' workflow and hive in general. By investigating the bees that leave the hive, we can gain a more complete understanding of the hive itself. For example, an unhealthy hive infected with varroa mites will have bees with deformed wings or mites on their backs. These characteristics can be observed without opening the hive. To protect against robber bees, we could track the ratio of pollen-carrying bees vs those without. A large influx of bees without pollen may be an indication of robber bees. This dataset aims to provide basic visual data to train machine learning models to classify bees in these categories, paving the way for more intelligent hive monitoring or beekeeping in general.
